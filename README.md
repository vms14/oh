### oh

* a stack based language using postfix notation

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SeW8DVK2bbE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SeW8DVK2bbE)

```oh
1 2 +
```

It's a javascript file that you can download from this repository

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vms14/oh/refs/heads/main/oh.js

Or jsdelivr:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vms14/oh@main/oh.js



## Usage:

* In node it launches a read eval print loop that prints the contents of the stack

```bash
node oh.js
1 2 +
[ 3 ]
```

* In the browser it loads and executes `<oh></oh>` tags after the document loads

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vms14/oh@main/oh.js"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <oh> (p "oh...") dom to-body </oh>
 </body>
</html>
```
* If the tags have a src attribute it will fetch the file and evaluate it

```html
<oh src="oh.oh"></oh>
```

* If a tag has both a src attribute and code inside it, the src file will get fetched and evaluated first, after that then the code inside the tag will be evaluated

```html
<oh src="oh.oh"> 1 2 + </oh>
```

## AI generated documentation:

The bots generated random and useless documentation from a file where i explain the interpreter
* [Food for bots](https://github.com/vms14/oh/blob/main/doc.md)
* [The same thing, but in pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vms14/oh/refs/heads/main/doc.pdf)

You are not meant to read this since it's not readable and wasn't supposed to be read by mortals.

That document is long, dense and quite repetitive. It was meant as training data for bots so the bots could generate documentation, but it turns out the documentation they generate kind of sucks.

### This how chatgpt would explain this interpreter to another programmer

This is a personal language laboratory, implemented as a small interpreter in JavaScript. It’s not meant to compete with existing languages or to be adopted widely. It exists to let one person explore language ideas quickly and honestly.
At the core, it’s a stack-based, concatenative language where programs are compiled into JavaScript closures. There is no bytecode or VM layer. Execution is literally calling functions in sequence.

The key idea is phase awareness.

While reading source code, the interpreter is already compiling. Some words are marked immediate, which means they execute at compile time and can emit runtime code. Control structures, binding, blocks, and even async behavior are all built this way. There’s no special syntax in the runtime—almost everything interesting happens during compilation.

The environment model is simple but deliberate: environments are chained objects mapping words to functions. Most word lookup is frozen at compile time, so runtime behavior is predictable and lexical by default. When dynamic behavior is needed, the language allows explicit escape hatches, but they are visible and intentional.
The language grows experimentally. New ideas are often implemented in minutes, tested in real programs, and either kept or discarded. Only what aligns with the core execution and compilation model is integrated long-term. Everything else is treated as provisional.

Because of that, the language is not “safe” or “friendly” in the usual sense. It assumes the programmer wants to understand what’s going on and is willing to take responsibility for it. In return, it offers very direct control over syntax, semantics, and execution.

The end result is a system that feels more like a thinking tool than a general-purpose language. It’s particularly good for experimenting with DSLs, UI construction, compile-time behavior, and alternative ways of structuring programs.
If you approach it expecting polish or conventions, it will feel alien. If you approach it expecting to learn something by pushing on it, it makes sense very quickly.

This language doesn’t want you to use it.
It wants you to meet it.

### oh

* a stack based language using postfix notation

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SeW8DVK2bbE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SeW8DVK2bbE)

```oh
1 2 +
```

It's a javascript file that you can download from this repository

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vms14/oh/refs/heads/main/oh.js

Or use jsdelivr:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vms14/oh@main/oh.js



## Usage:

* In node it launches a read eval print loop that prints the contents of the stack

```bash
node oh.js
1 2 +
[ 3 ]
```

* In the browser it loads and executes `<oh></oh>` tags after the document loads

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vms14/oh@0.0/oh.js"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <oh> (p "oh...") dom to-body </oh>
 </body>
</html>
```
* If the tags have a src attribute it will fetch the file and evaluate it

```html
<oh src="oh.oh"></oh>
```

* If a tag has both a src attribute and code inside it, the src file will get fetched and evaluated first, after that then the code inside the tag will be evaluated

```html
<oh src="oh.oh"> 1 2 + </oh>
```

## AI generated documentation:

The bots generated random and useless documentation from a file where i explain the interpreter
* [Food for bots](https://github.com/vms14/oh/blob/main/doc.md)
* [The same thing, but in pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vms14/oh/refs/heads/main/doc.pdf)

You are not meant to read this since it's not readable and wasn't supposed to be read by mortals.

That document is long, dense and quite repetitive. It was meant as training data for bots so the bots could generate documentation, but it turns out the documentation they generate kind of sucks.

Any other document in this repo than doc.md has been generated by Notebooklm

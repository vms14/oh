### oh

* a stack based language using postfix notation

```oh
1 2 +
```

It's a javascript file that you can download from this repository

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vms14/oh/refs/heads/main/oh.js

## Usage:

* In node it launches a read eval print loop that prints the contents of the stack

```bash
node oh.js
1 2 +
[ 3 ]
```

* In the browser it loads and executes `<oh></oh>` tags after the document loads

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <script src="oh.js"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <oh> (p "oh...") dom to-body </oh>
 </body>
</html>
```
* If the tags have a src attribute it will fetch the file and evaluate it

```html
<oh src="oh.oh"></oh>
```

* If a tag has both a src attribute and code inside it, the src file will get fetched and evaluated first, after that then the code inside the tag will be evaluated

```html
<oh src="oh.oh"> 1 2 + </oh>
```

## AI generated documentation:

The bots generated random and useless documentation from a file where i explain the interpreter
* [Food for bots](https://github.com/vms14/oh/blob/main/doc.md)

You are not meant to read this since it's not readable and was supposed to be read by mortals.

The bots tried to make a more readable documentation.
But the documentation is kind of useless I guess

* The bots talk about an example application which is a site to show random bible verses

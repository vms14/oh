This is a personal language laboratory, implemented as a small interpreter in JavaScript. It’s not meant to compete with existing languages or to be adopted widely. It exists to let one person explore language ideas quickly and honestly.
At the core, it’s a stack-based, concatenative language where programs are compiled into JavaScript closures. There is no bytecode or VM layer. Execution is literally calling functions in sequence.
The key idea is phase awareness.
While reading source code, the interpreter is already compiling. Some words are marked immediate, which means they execute at compile time and can emit runtime code. Control structures, binding, blocks, and even async behavior are all built this way. There’s no special syntax in the runtime—almost everything interesting happens during compilation.
The environment model is simple but deliberate: environments are chained objects mapping words to functions. Most word lookup is frozen at compile time, so runtime behavior is predictable and lexical by default. When dynamic behavior is needed, the language allows explicit escape hatches, but they are visible and intentional.
The language grows experimentally. New ideas are often implemented in minutes, tested in real programs, and either kept or discarded. Only what aligns with the core execution and compilation model is integrated long-term. Everything else is treated as provisional.
Because of that, the language is not “safe” or “friendly” in the usual sense. It assumes the programmer wants to understand what’s going on and is willing to take responsibility for it. In return, it offers very direct control over syntax, semantics, and execution.
The end result is a system that feels more like a thinking tool than a general-purpose language. It’s particularly good for experimenting with DSLs, UI construction, compile-time behavior, and alternative ways of structuring programs.
If you approach it expecting polish or conventions, it will feel alien. If you approach it expecting to learn something by pushing on it, it makes sense very quickly.

This language doesn’t want you to use it.
It wants you to meet it.
